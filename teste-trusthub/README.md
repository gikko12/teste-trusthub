# TesteTrusthub

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
For a dynamic backend mock, go to the directory "/mock" on this project, install json-server if you don't have it yet (npm install -g json-server) and run the command json-server --watch mock.json. This will mock all the backend request, allowing some operations that a simple json file would request more logic then necessary.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
